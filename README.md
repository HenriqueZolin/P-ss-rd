<h2>P@ss**rd App</h2>

Trying to devolpe a useful program, i realized that all my passswords were weak and i only had a few of them.
This made me realize that i should create  program that would store my password and users, in thi P@ss**rd app i can store all of them and even generate new ones,
Storing all of them in a database the most challanging feature was of course, securing all data, it was a fun challange witch gave me a lot more confidance in future projects
